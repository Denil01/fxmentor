                    <h4>How do I know the right courses for me?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Knowing how to choose the right course for a person depends on the individual. But according to my experiences with my previous students, I would recomend one to pick a course depending on their level of trading skills. If you are new to forex, mentorship is a great place to begin your journey of learning forex. If you struggle to pass prop firm challenges you can opt to have a one on one mentorship session with our skilled tutor in-order to determine the reason behind the problem.

                    <p>
                        Yes we offer payments in installments for our mentorship program only. One will be required to pay half of the mentorship course fee and settle the rest after one and a half months (1.5 months).

                    <h4>How long is the mentorship course?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The mentorship course will last for 3 months, consisting of the theory in the first month, detailed practice in the second month, and finally a one on one session with the tutor as you trade demo in the last month. Do however note that you will always have trading support for a lifetime.

                    <h4>How long is the prop firm bootcamp?</h4>

                        The prop firm bootcamp will take a maximum period of two weeks (14 days). This is a one on one session with the tutor. But note that we can always help you whenever you need help in the future at no additional cost, this will be once every month.

                        The mentorship sessions will last for 2 hours per sitting. Sometimes it may increase by 30 miinutes as I may be reviewing the practical assignments from the previous classes.

                    <h4>Is there a refund?</h4>

                        Refunds will only be given in full if one has not started the course yet. But if one has began the course and wants to ask for their refund, we will have to calculate how long one has being in session and then deduct that from the total fee paid.
